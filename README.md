### Brief description 

Pipeline started out as a giant shell-script developed specifically for analysing neuroblastoma samples sequenced as WGS in stockholm for Tommy Martinssons research group. Contact: Susanne Fransson 

Pipeline was converted to Snakemake, and updated in various ways, including a transition from hg19 to hg38 as a reference genome in conjunction with the project from BarncancerFonden in association with Genomic Medicine Sweden.
