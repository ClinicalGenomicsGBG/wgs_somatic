# Complimentary scripts to wgs_somatic pipeline
## Clean up webstore directory - replace bams with crams
The `submit_bam2cram.py` script automates the process of replacing BAM files with CRAM files in a webstore directory. It uses Snakemake (`convert_bam_to_cram.smk`) to perform the conversion of bam to cram and create the index .crai files. It includes features like parallel processing, lock file management, and optional BAM file retention.  

### Features
Parallel Processing: The script processes multiple directories in parallel, improving efficiency.
Lock File Management: Prevents multiple instances of the script from processing the same directory simultaneously.
Dry Run Mode: Simulates the execution without making any changes to the filesystem.
Customizable Options: Allows users to configure the webstore directory, working directory, age threshold, and more.
Postprocessing: Automatically transfers CRAM/CRAI files to the webstore directory and optionally deletes BAM/BAI files.
If cram files already exist, the script will skip the conversion for that directory, as well as skipping deleting the bam files.

### Usage

```bash
> python tools/bam_cleanup/submit_bam2cram.py --help
Usage: submit_bam2cram.py [OPTIONS]

  Replace BAM files with CRAM files in webstore

Options:
  --webstore_dir PATH          Base webstore directory  [default:
                               /webstore/clinical/routine/wgs_somatic/current;
                               required]
  --workdir PATH               Base execution directory where snakemake will
                               create cram and crai  [default:
                               /clinical/data/wgs_somatic/bam_cleanup_workdir;
                               required]
  --age_threshold INTEGER      Age threshold in days  [default: 50]
  --dry_run                    Perform a dry run without making any changes
  --extra_snakemake_args TEXT  Extra arguments for snakemake command
  --launcher_config PATH       Path to the launcher config file  [default: <automatically detected path based on wgs_somatic repo location>/wgs_somatic/tools/
                               ../configs/launcher_config.json; required]
  --snakemake_config PATH      Path to the snakemake config file  [default: <automatically detected path based on wgs_somatic repo location>/wgs_somatic/tools
                               /../configs/cluster.yaml; required]
  --keep_bam                   Do not delete BAM files after conv
```

The defaults are already set, so it can be run like this:

```bash
python tools/bam_cleanup/submit_bam2cram.py
```

### Workflow
1. Directory Scanning:

The script scans the specified webstore_dir for directories containing BAM files.
Directories are filtered based on the age_threshold.

2. Lock File Creation:

A .bam2cram.processing.lock file is created in each directory to prevent duplicate processing.
Stale lock files older than 24 hours are automatically removed.

3. Snakemake Execution:

The script submits a Snakemake job for each directory to convert BAM files to CRAM format.

4. Postprocessing:

CRAM/CRAI files are transferred to the webstore directory.
BAM/BAI files are optionally deleted if --keep_bam is not specified.
Temporary working directories are cleaned up.

5. Logging:

Logs are written to a file in the logs directory (replace_bam_w_cram.log) and also displayed in the console.

### Output 

Converted CRAM and CRAI files are saved in the same directory as the original BAM files. Bam files are deleted if the --keep_bam option is not specified.  
Logs are saved in the logs directory at the root of the repository.
